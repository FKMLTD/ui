# Nominators

Nominators have a responsibility to elect the most trustworthy validators to secure the network.
To become a nominator you must stake CENNZ tokens and then vote for your preferred validators.
Nominators will share proportionally in Cpay rewards if their validator(s) are elected and
participates correctly.
If their chosen validators behave maliciously the nominator's stake will be slashed
proportionally along with the validators.
e.g. if a nominator contributes 30% of a validators total stake they may receive 30% of the reward.
Conversely, nominator will share 30% of slashes (confiscation of CENNZ) if the validator misbehaves.

Nominators are encouraged and incentivized to stay aware of validator activity and change their nominations if required.

# Validators

Accounts linked with CENNZnet nodes, make blocks and participate in consensus protocols to secure the network.
Validators have a right to set a commission rate reward which will be deducted before sharing with nominators.
Validators earn Cpay rewards but can incur slash if they misbehave in the protocol.
